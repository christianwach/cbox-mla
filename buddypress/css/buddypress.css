The empty file you see before you once contained BuddyPress
styles. These files had to be removed in order to create our own
custom styles, but this file, empty though it is, must remain
here, so that BuddyPress will overwrite its own buddypress.css
with this one, thereby allowing us to write our own styles from
scratch.
