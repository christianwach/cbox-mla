# Changes in Version 2.1.0 

 * User profiles are now highly configurable "portfolios," thanks to a plugin initially developed for the CUNY Academic Commons. Members can now add their positions, publications, educational data, and custom fields to their profiles, and rearrange their order. This portfolio is displayed in a clean, clutter-free interface that prints nicely to paper or PDF.  
 * Buddypress-docs has a cleaned-up interface. It no longer gives users the arguably unnecessary options of changing the associated group of a doc, or of changing its access rights or parent doc.  
 * WordPress has been updated to 4.0. Additional version upgrades include: 
  - Akismet -> 3.0.2
  - BP Group Documents -> 1.6
  - CommentPress Code -> 3.5.9
  - WP Accessibility -> 1.3.7

# Changes in Version 2.0 

 * The site has been given a new, flat theme. Gradients, textures, and 3D buttons have been replaced by simple, minimalistic elements. The colorscheme has been also simplified, favoring desaturated colors and grayscale over the bright reds and oranges of the previous theme. 
 * Many redundant UI elements have been removed. Some subscription links have been removed in favor of the "Email Subscriptions" group tab. Pagination buttons that previously appeared on the top and bottom of any content area now only appear at the bottom. Forums titles that bear the same titles as their groups have been removed. 
 * The default homepage for groups is now "Forum." The group tab previously called "Home" is now more accurately termed "Activity." 
 * The sitewide wiki has been removed. However, documents created there are still available in user profiles, and may still be associated with groups. 
 * Help-related items on the homepage have been moved to a dropdown item revealed by clicking the homepage menu item "help." 
 * Group announcements have been removed. Group administrators who wish to make announcements may do so by making forum posts.  
 * The "Docs" plugin has been redesigned in a new, minimal style that transforms formerly tabular data into easier-to-read prose.
